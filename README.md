# STL-watermarking

This program embeds a hidden watermark on an ascii-based STL file. The purpose was to provide a means for digital artists and companies to leave a digital fingerprint on their intellectual property.

The watermark is also resistent to certain transformations such as scaling and translation. Rotation and reflection distort the watermark. Nearly STL file would work, but more triangles yield better results.
